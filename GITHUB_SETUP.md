# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Your modernized PHP LMS has been successfully pushed to GitHub! Here's how to complete the setup and configure your CI/CD pipeline.

## üéâ Repository Status

‚úÖ **Repository**: https://github.com/dGreatNoob/php-lms  
‚úÖ **Branches Created**:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `staging` - Pre-production testing 
- `dev` - Active development

‚úÖ **All modernization files committed and pushed**

## üîß GitHub Repository Configuration

### 1. Branch Protection Rules

Go to **Settings > Branches** in your GitHub repository and set up protection rules:

#### For `main` branch:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Required status checks: `test` (from CI workflow)
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ‚úÖ Require linear history

#### For `staging` branch:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging

### 2. GitHub Actions Secrets

Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add these secrets:

#### üîí Required Secrets for Staging Deployment
```
STAGING_HOST          = your-staging-server-ip-or-domain
STAGING_USER          = your-ssh-username
STAGING_SSH_KEY       = your-private-ssh-key-content
STAGING_BASE_URL      = https://staging.yourdomain.com
STAGING_DB_NAME       = php_lms_staging
STAGING_DB_USER       = staging_db_user
STAGING_DB_PASS       = staging_db_password
```

#### üîí Required Secrets for Production Deployment
```
PROD_HOST             = your-production-server-ip-or-domain
PROD_USER             = your-ssh-username
PROD_SSH_KEY          = your-private-ssh-key-content
PROD_BASE_URL         = https://yourdomain.com
PROD_DB_NAME          = php_lms_prod
PROD_DB_USER          = prod_db_user
PROD_DB_PASS          = prod_db_password
```

#### üîî Optional Notification Secret
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL     = your-slack-webhook-url-for-notifications
```

### 3. SSH Key Setup for Deployments

If you don't have SSH keys set up yet:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair (run this on your local machine)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/php_lms_deploy

# Copy public key to your servers
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/php_lms_deploy.pub user@your-staging-server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/php_lms_deploy.pub user@your-production-server

# Copy private key content for GitHub secrets
cat ~/.ssh/php_lms_deploy
# Copy this entire output (including -----BEGIN/END----- lines) to STAGING_SSH_KEY and PROD_SSH_KEY secrets
```

## üöÄ Testing Your CI/CD Pipeline

### 1. Test the CI Pipeline

Create a simple test to verify the CI pipeline works:

```bash
# Switch to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Make a small change to test CI
echo "# Test CI Pipeline" >> TEST_CI.md
git add TEST_CI.md
git commit -m "test: Add CI pipeline test file"
git push origin dev
```

Then check **Actions** tab in GitHub to see the CI workflow running.

### 2. Test Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/test-workflow

# Make some changes
echo "Testing workflow" > test_workflow.txt
git add test_workflow.txt
git commit -m "feat: Add test workflow file"
git push origin feature/test-workflow
```

Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from `feature/test-workflow` to `dev`.

### 3. Test Staging Deployment

After setting up staging server and secrets:

```bash
# Merge your feature to staging (via PR or directly)
git checkout staging
git merge dev
git push origin staging
```

This should trigger the staging deployment workflow.

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Setup Instructions

### Staging Server Setup

```bash
# On your staging server:
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/php-lms-staging
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www/php-lms-staging
cd /var/www/php-lms-staging

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dGreatNoob/php-lms.git .

# Create environment file
cp .env.staging.example .env.staging
nano .env.staging  # Edit with your staging database credentials

# Set permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
mkdir -p storage/logs storage/sessions backups/staging
```

### Production Server Setup

```bash
# On your production server:
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/php-lms-production
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www/php-lms-production
cd /var/www/php-lms-production

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dGreatNoob/php-lms.git .

# Create environment file
cp .env.production.example .env.production
nano .env.production  # Edit with your production database credentials

# Set permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
mkdir -p storage/logs storage/sessions backups/production
```

## üîç Monitoring Your Setup
